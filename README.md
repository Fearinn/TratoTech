## ‚úèÔ∏è How to use 

This project uses a fake API from **json-server**. You need to run it locally in order to use all features of the application.

Download the repository and follow these steps:

- `npm install`
- `npm run server` (make sure it uses localhost:3000)
- use `npm run start` to run the application locally or use the version hosted in Vercel.
